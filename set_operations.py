# Python Program to Illustrate Different Set Operations

# Define two sets
E = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Union
print("Union of E and N is", E.union(N))

# Intersection
print("Intersection of E and N is", E.intersection(N))

# Difference
print("Difference of E and N is", E.difference(N))

# Symmetric Difference
print("Symmetric difference of E and N is", E.symmetric_difference(N))
